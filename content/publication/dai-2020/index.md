abstract: We have identified certain fundamental limitations of a mixing-length parametrization
  used in a popular turbulent kinetic energy-based subgrid-scale model. Replacing
  this parametrization with a more physically realistic one significantly improves
  the overall quality of the large-eddy simulation (LES) of stable boundary layers.
  For the range of grid sizes considered here (specifically, 1 m--12.5 m), the revision
  dramatically reduces the grid-size sensitivity of the simulations. Most importantly,
  the revised scheme allows us to reliably estimate the first- and second-order statistics
  of a well-known LES intercomparison case, even with a coarse grid size of O(10 m).
