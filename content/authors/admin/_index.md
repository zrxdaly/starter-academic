I received my master degree in track of Environmental Science in 2020 from TU Delft. At the same year, I start my PhD program at the department of Geoscience and Remote sensing in the project of “Clarity on Fruit frost” under the supervision of Bas van de Wiel. My main interests in this project is to quantify the efficiency of engineering method used as frost mitigation using numerical simulation. I am interested in atmospheric modelling and boundary layer meteorology.
